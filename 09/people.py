CSAPX Week 3: Searching and Sorting

Author: Sean Strout @ RIT CS

A program that searches for a person by first and last name using:

- linear search: complexity scales linearly. O(N)
- binary search: complexity scales at a logarithmic base 2 rate. O(log2 N)

The person is a dataclass that is read in from a csv file in the format:
    id, first, last, email, gender, ip
